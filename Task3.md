# Moviefy

## Requirements
Create an app for browsing movies. The user should be able to:

* Browse through preview lists with currently trending, popular, top-rated and upcoming movies.
* Expand any of those lists and scroll through them infinitely.
* Search for movies.
* Save movies and mark them as Watched/To-Watch. These should be available even in offline mode.

The description of a movie from a list could be just a thumbnail, and maybe a title.
On movie tap, its details should be displayed. They should contain, at least title, short description, thumbnail, release date, runtime and the average rating.

# Meals Traker

## Requirements
Create an app for daily tracking of meals like lunch and dinner. The user should be able to browse a list of meals and add new ones to it. The list should contain sections based on meal type and date. A meal should be described by at least a title, date, type, colour and an appropriate number of servings per week or month. When adding a meal to the list, the user should be able to create a new one, choose from already tracked or default ones, or get a suggestion based on his meals history. Weekly and monthly analytics would be helpful.

## Tips
- Don't forget to check `Use Core Data` while creating the project.

## If you are lost
Start by creating a list without any sections. Leave for now analytics and saving the meals to **CoreData**. For a start create default meals only.
